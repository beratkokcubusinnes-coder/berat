# Admin User Created Successfully! 🎉

## Login Credentials

- **Email**: `berat@promptda.com`
- **Username**: `berat_memisoglu`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Role**: `admin`

## What Happened?

The database was reset during the migration. All user data was lost, so I recreated your admin account.

## Next Steps

1. **Logout** if you're currently logged in
2. **Login again** with the credentials above
3. Your admin panel access will be restored

## To Login:

Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/en/login`

Or use this script to login directly:
```bash
node scripts/create-admin.js
```

## Note:

If you want to change your password, you can do so from the settings page after logging in.
